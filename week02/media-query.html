            <p>And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never 
                before heard nor seen. And many years pass away before he shall manifest himself 
                in the flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole.

            <h2>Omni 1:18</h2>
            <p>But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that they should be taught in his language. 
                And it came to pass that after they were taught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla 
                gave a genealogy of his fathers, according to his memory; and they are written, 
                but not in these plates.
